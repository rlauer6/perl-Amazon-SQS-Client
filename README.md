This is the README file for the `perl-Amazon-SQS-Client` project.

This is a fork of the `Amazon::SQS::Client` package distributed by
Amazon a few years ago.  Their abandonment of Perl is epic, so it is
up to the Perl community to hack-patch these modules.  Here is my
attempt at hack-patching.

HACKS TO ORIGINAL PROJECT
=========================

1. Create an RPM - this project will help you create an RPM
2. An example queue daemon - this project presents an example daemon
for handling SQS messages (`QueueDaemon.pl`).
3. Long polling - support for API version 2012-11-05 `WaitTimeSeconds`
parameter to the `ReceiveMessage`

*Note there has been no attempt to update all of the API calls to
support differences between version 2009-02-01 of the API and
2012-11-05 version other than adding `WaitTimeSeconds` to the
parameter list for `Amazon::SQS::Model::ReceiveMessageReques`.*

OVERVIEW
========

This project contains Perl modules and example Perl scripts that
interface with Amazon Web Service's Simple Queue Service.  The Amazon
SQS is designed to be a component in distributed cloud based
applications.  It implements a simple message queueing system which
allows you to send and receive messages that your programs might use
for interprocess communications.

See `INSTALL` for information on how to build and instal this project.

See `BUGS` for information on how to report problems with this
project.

See `/usr/share/amazon-web-services/sqs/ReadMe.html` for the
information about how to use these modules.


EXAMPLES
========

The original Amazon SQS library was distributed as a .zip file with
example scripts found in the `amazon-queue/src/Amazon/SQS/Samples`
directory.  The example files were skeletons that you were expected to
flesh out by adding your AWS credentials and instantiate the correct
parameters to send to the module being tested.

The examples in this project have been modified from their original
version so that they will read a configuration file (.ini style) named
`aws-sqs.ini` located in the `/usr/share/amazon-web-services/sqs'
directory.

After installation of the package read the Perldocs which describe the
format of this file and what you are expected to do to configure the
examples.

```
 $ perldoc Amazon::SQS::Config
```

WHERE TO GO FROM HERE
=====================

You can try any of the examples in the `../Samples` directory referenced
above.

`QueueDaemon.pl`
--------------

This is a reference implementation...the idea is for you to look at it
and modify it accordingly.  It does not actually do anything.


Author(s)
=========

The original Perl modules were (apparently) written/generated by
someone whose email address is:

`<Elena@AWS>`

..so clearly the credit for the concept, excecution, content, and
substance, should go to that individual(s).  Likewise, please heap
accolades, carps, whines, and other forms of acknowledgments toward
that person(s) direction with regard to the software itself.

If you are at all annoyed at the packaging, wish it were a proper CPAN
module or other such nonsense than direct your venom here:

Rob Lauer - `<rlauer6@comcast.net>`

You'll find some extra goodies that may or may not be of any value:

*  `Amazon::SQS::Config` - configuration file access
*  `QueDaemon.pl` - a base class for handling simple messages placed on SQS queues
*  `aws-sqsd` - bash script for starting a queue handling daemon
